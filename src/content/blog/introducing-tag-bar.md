Thanks for being part of [Mindi](https://mindi.ai/) while we’re in early access. Here’s a quick update on what’s new and what we’ve been working on recently.

## ⚡️ Tag bar overview

We’ve made it easier for you to explore things you save to Mindi. By simply clicking through images, articles, tweets, and websites, you will re-discover important items you’ve saved to Mindi.

## Invite a friend to Mindi

We made it super easy for you to invite friends. Simply enter their email address and we’ll let them know they’re invited and they’ll bypass our waitlist. ![](https://bucket.mlcdn.com/a/3732/3732146/images/78b9d6de1da0ea5b2c267695cba75ba5ae7f181f.gif)
