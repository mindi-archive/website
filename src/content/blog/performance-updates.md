Our main focus this month has been improving the performance of the app. The biggest update is instant saving.

## Server upgrades

After we hit 300 users (🥳), some of you might’ve experienced minor slow downs, and our service might’ve been temporarily unavailable for a few moments. We’ve upgraded our servers and things should be back to normal now.

## Instant saving

We made some changes to how we handle collections to allow instant saving of bookmarks. Previously, saving a bookmark to Mindi would sometimes take up to 10 seconds — now it’s instant! 🤯 

In addition, we removed the colored rings so that you can create unlimited collections.
