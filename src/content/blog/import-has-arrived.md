We're excited to announce that the import feature has finally landed and is ready for you to use.

To get started, just head over to the **Settings** view in the Mindi app and look for the import link at the bottom. You'll be prompted to upload the exported HTML file with all your bookmarks.

To do so in Chrome, go to your **Bookmark Manager** by pressing `⌥⌘+B` on Mac or `CTRL+⇧+B` on Windows. Once there, hit the three dots in the top right corner and choose `Export bookmarks`. This is the file you'll need for importing into Mindi.

Once inside, click on the three dots in the top left corner, and select `Export bookmarks`. Use this file when importing to Mindi.

To export bookmarks from other browsers, check out this [guide](https://kb.lynn.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97944937).

If you notice any issues during or after the import, give us a shout.
