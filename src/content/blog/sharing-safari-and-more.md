This time around, we’re bringing three major updates to Mindi, all of which you asked us for.

## Share feature

Let’s start with our biggest update, card sharing. Now you can share anything you save to Mindi. It can be a video, a tweet, an article, or anything else you have saved.

Mindi’s sharing is unique because you can attach a note instead of just sharing a naked link.

Check this out in action [here](https://at.mindi.ai/e/Tq7cgecxw5Rh).

## Create a new collection from the extension

You can now create a new collection straight from the extension popup, without having to go to Mindi dashboard.

## Add an image or a text to a collection

So far, there was only an option to add images and text to Mindi. As a result, users couldn’t quickly add something to a collection using the right-click feature. You can now add images and text directly to any existing collection.

## Safari extension

We’re happy to announce that our extension now works on Safari too. You can get it [here](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mindi-for-safari/id1617041643?l=en).

That’s all for now, stay tuned for more. For feature requests or feedback, please reach out to [support@mindi.ai.](mailto:support@mindi.ai.)
