You may have noticed that we’ve been less active over the past few months, with fewer major feature releases. Sometimes in software development, it’s necessary to pause and focus on ensuring the product is ready for scaling and growth. 

As a result, we’ve been working on many behind-the-scenes improvements that will benefit the product in the long run.

Taking this time to enhance the core of our product will enable us to move faster in the future.

## Major search improvements

We’ve made significant updates to Mindi’s search functionality and fixed minor issues that may have occurred during its use. In doing so, we’ve also substantially improved the app’s in-app performance.

## Infinite scroll

Mindi should now feel faster and more responsive than ever before. We’ve introduced infinite scroll, which allows Mindi to run smoothly even when you have a large number of saved bookmarks.

## Visual updates

You may have noticed visual changes in the dashboard, including new icons, updated colors, improved actions around bookmarks, and numerous other small improvements.

## New logo

We’ve refreshed our logo, transitioning from our original elephant (which we still love) to one that better represents our vision. The new logo was created by the incredibly talented designer [Fabian](https://twitter.com/fabianarbor). 

## Coming up next: Import of bookmarks 

We’re currently working on a highly requested import feature. Although we’ve finished building the feature, we’re still testing it and gradually rolling it out to users. If you’d like to access the import feature early, please reply to this email, and we’ll enable it for you.

As usual, don’t be shy with your feedback, hit us up via [email](mailto:support@mindi.ai?subject=Feedback) or join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Ctcz5GpG2Y).

Big thanks to those of you that already have!

Speak soon,
